# Student Grade Tracker

A modular Student Grade Tracker built in C# using clean architecture principles. This application allows users to input, validate, and analyze student grades with a focus on maintainability, encapsulation, and reusable logic.

## Features

- 📊 Add and track student grades
- ✅ Input validation and error handling
- 🧱 Layered architecture for separation of concerns
- 🔁 Designed for replication in JavaScript and TypeScript
- 🧼 Clean code, semantic commits, and traceable workflow

## Architecture

- **Domain Layer**: Core business logic and models
- **Application Layer**: Services and validation
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Data access and persistence
- **Presentation Layer**: Console-based UI (can be extended)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/devmanidhiman/StudentGradeTracker.git
2. - Open the solution in Visual Studio
3. - Build and run the application


## Goals

This project is part of a cross-language learning initiative. After completing the C# version, it will be replicated in JavaScript and TypeScript to reinforce architectural patterns and transferable skills.
